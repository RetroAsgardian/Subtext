# Subtext
Subtext is an open-source, secure, private, decentralized alternative chat platform, similar to Discord or Skype. It uses end-to-end PGP encryption to protect your messages. Anyone can host their own public or private instance easily.

This repository contains the server code for Subtext.

(By the way, we have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/dt5bfHB).)

## Dependencies
- .NET Core 3.0
- Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (For now...)
- A computer
- Some nice, hot ***moist caffeine***
- That's it

## Installing
- We have a shell script
- Actually we don't
- But we'll add one later

## Forking Etiquette
If you create a fork, please change `variant` in `Program.cs` to your repository name. This helps us understand and solve bug reports involving unofficial server variants, and informs users about the code running on each instance.
